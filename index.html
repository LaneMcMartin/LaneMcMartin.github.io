            <!-- <p>For our capstone project, we designed a wearable health monitor to track of heart rate, blood oxygen, and skin temperature.
              This involved collaborating within a team to draft an electrical schematic in KiCAD that integrated the client’s own processor into the design.
              Leading the firmware for the project, I worked with C++, MATLAB, and the client-owned cross-compiler to write the firmware for the onboard processor.
              I also wrote detailed documentation regarding the design rationale, construction, and operation of the device.

            <p>
              This project involved collaborating with a team and a
              client to design a product that could measure, analyze, and transmit information using the client’s own
              processor.
              <br><br>
              Datasheet inspection, electrical analysis, and schematic capture provided ample experience across the 
              development lifecycle. Documentation detailing the functionality, design process, and
              operating conditions of the project greatly improved my technical writing. Spearheading the project firmware, I
              gained experience writing C++ and MATALAB. Finally, I
              grew as a leader through scheduling meetings, organizing documents, maintaining schedules, and taking initiative.
              <br><br>
              Our project ranked in the top 3; and I returned the next year as a volunteer judge for the course!

          <p>I've wanted to put together my own portfolio website for a while now, so I decided to challenge myself
            and see if I could put something together over a weekend. I was surprised at how quickly I was able to
            dust off HTML/CSS after a few years and I'm very happy with how the site turned out!

          <h1 class="highlight_dark">Necromancer Reloaded - Godot Game</h1>
          <p>After making a game in Unity for a Hackathon, I became more interested in persuing game development as a hobby.
            This led me to discover the Godot engine, an open-source game engine that uses GDScript (a dynamically-typed Python-esque langauge)
            and C#. Curious to try learning a new (albeit niche) programming language and a new engine, I decided to make my next game in Godot.
            <br><br>
            "Necromancer Reloaded" is a reimagining of a previous Hackathon game I worked on in Python (<a href="https://github.com/huddy987/Necromancer-Game" class="whitelink">click here</a>)!
            The game is a top-down shooter where you play as a Necromancer holding off an onslaught of knights. After killing a knight, a gravestone is dropped.
            By holding the right mouse button, the player can conjure a resurrection spell (becoming immobile while in the process) that will convert graves to ghosts.
            These ghosts will fight for the player and automatically attack nearby knights.
            <br><br>
            It was very satisfying to learn a new language and tool from the ground up. It was also rewarding to see how far I've come
            in my ability to learn new programming langauges and concepts.

          <h1 class="highlight_dark">virus.exe - C# Hackathon Game</h1>
          <p>For HackED 2022 (a hackathon at the University of Alberta) my friends and I
            collaborated to create a PC game in Unity over 24 hours. This offered me the chance
            to learn C# and exercise some creative skills in asset development and game design!
            <br><br>
            In "virus.exe" the player is presented with a fictional OS that has been infected with a virus.
            Windows with advertisements appear across the desktop, and the player must close them before they get "corrupted"
            and become uncloseable. If 10 ads get corrupted, the game ends. Over time, the frequency of ads increase and special 
            variations spawn. For instance, a cold-themed advertisement can spawn - which must be clicked several times to shatter
            the ice covering the ad before it can be closed.
            <br><br>
            I worked on the window-spawning, game-flow control, and visual aspects of the project. I also worked on spriting and placing 
            elements of the UI. This was my first time committing to making a game in Unity - so it was fun learning how to use the tools and navigate the documentation!
